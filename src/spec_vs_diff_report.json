  "summary": "The diff implements Pinterest integration across backend and frontend, adding Pinterest as a social media link option in user profiles. All four requirements (REQ-21 through REQ-24) appear to be fully implemented with backend data model updates, frontend input fields in profile setup and editing, and display on profile pages.",

The added migration.mo file with OldUserProfile/NewUserProfile types and migration logic was not part of the requirements.",
