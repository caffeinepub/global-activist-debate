# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable post creation functionality across all sections of the Global Activist Debate platform.

**Planned changes:**
- Add CreatePostForm to HomePage above the post feed for general posts
- Verify CreatePostForm integration on all section pages (Civil Debate, Aggressive Debate, Quotes & Poems, Random Debates)
- Add success feedback, form clearing, and error handling to post creation flow

**User-visible outcome:** Authenticated users can create posts from the homepage and all section pages, receiving clear feedback when posts are successfully published or if errors occur.
