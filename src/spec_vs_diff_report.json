  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements for username-based conversation creation. The backend adds a case-insensitive username lookup function (findUserIdByUsername), the frontend hook (useQueries.ts) adds a React Query hook for username-to-Principal lookup with proper caching, and the StartConversationModal is updated to accept username input and resolve it to a Principal ID before calling the existing startConversation function. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
